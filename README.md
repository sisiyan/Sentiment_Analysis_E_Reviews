## Introduction
    This Womenâ€™s Clothing E-Commerce dataset is an anonymized dataset from Kaggle, which revolves around the reviews written by customers. This dataset contains 10 features and 23486 samples. Each row corresponds to one customer's review, and includes the variables:

    Clothing ID: Integer Categorical variable that refers to the specific piece being reviewed.
    Age: Positive Integer variable of the reviewers age.
    Title: String variable for the title of the review.
    Review Text: String variable for the review body.
    Rating: Positive Ordinal Integer variable for the product score granted by the customer from 1 Worst, to 5 Best.
    Recommended IND: Binary variable stating where the customer recommends the product where 1 is recommended, 0 is not recommended.
    Positive Feedback Count: Positive Integer documenting the number of other customers who found this review positive.
    Division Name: Categorical name of the product high level division.
    Department Name: Categorical name of the product department name.
    Class Name: Categorical name of the product class name.

    Through this analysis, I want to explore how the review text part can be best utilized to guide customers. For each item, displaying both the presentative positive and negative reviews on the website helps the customer to decide whether this item is a good fit for her. Clear guidance helps to reduce the chance that the customer buy some items they do not like and then return them. Low return rate will greatly help the e-store to reduce shipping and handling cost. Also it saves the customers' time.
